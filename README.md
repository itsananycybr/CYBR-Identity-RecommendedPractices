Please note:
1. This repository code is to be used as a recommendation only and all configuraitons should be valiadted by your ITSec team and approved by them.
2. Errors in the log file mean an actual error, or the object exists already. 
3. In case you already have a running production(or other) tenant, with existing configurations and policies, reconsider if you want to deploy this method here. it will write "above" the existing policies, and may rewrite some details and objects.(may have direct impact on existing workflows)
Please feel free to report issues and sugegstions to be considered.
